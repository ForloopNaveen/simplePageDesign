                <h2>Quality by Design (QbD)</h2>
                <p>QbD involves a proactive approach to clinical development, emphasizing the integration of quality throughout the entire process. This involves understanding the processes, potential outcomes, and associated risks. By identifying and addressing these risks early on, QbD aims to ensure consistent, high-quality, fit-to-purpose data throughout the clinical trial.

                <h2>Risk-Based Approach to QbD</h2>
                <span>QbD follows a series of steps to achieve its goals:</span>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Early Pre-Risk Assessment (EPRA):</b>This is the first step, where the team brainstorms and identifies potential risks associated with the clinical study very early stages. The team then prioritizes these risks and devises ways to mitigate them.</li>
                    <li><b>Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planning: </b>Once risks are identified, they are further analysed to understand how likely they are to happen and how severe they could be. Functional plans are then created to address these risks and minimize their impact on the trial.</li>
                    <li><b>Protocol Data Model (PDM):</b>The PDM is a standardized approach to manage all the data collected during the trial. It ensures that all the important information is captured and readily available for analysis. This involves mapping out how data will flow (Data Flow Mapping), planning how it will be collected (Data Acquisition strategy), and creating a system for reviewing it (Integrated Data Review Plan).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Risk-Based Data Science:</h2>
                <span>Central Data Surveillance </span>
                <p>The data is continuously monitored throughout the trial to identify any deviations from the expected quality standards. This can involve real-time monitoring of diverse data, analysing trends in the data, and conducting regular data audits. Having a centralized system for data surveillance allows for a comprehensive view of the information and helps catch potential issues early.</p>

                <h2>Action & Decision Insights: </h2>
                <p>The data collected through these QbD processes provides valuable insights that can be used to make informed decisions. This data can help you:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Address problems early and ensure the data is usable for its intended purpose.</li>
                    <li>dentify areas where the process can be improved.</li>
                    <li>Optimize both internal and external processes involved in the trial.</li>
                    <li>Make data-driven decisions throughout the development process.</li>
